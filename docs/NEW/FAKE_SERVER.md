# Fake Server

A local stand-in for the DTA and legacy pronunciation servers, so the app can be tested
without a backend. It lives in [`FakeServer/`](../../FakeServer/), outside `Assets`, so Unity
does not import it. It needs Python 3 and nothing else.

**What it can't prove:** its responses are built from the app's response classes and the
server rules noted in the client's comments, not from the real server. It tests how the app
handles a response, not whether the real server sends that response. Run the
[backend checks](MIGRATION.md#checks-waiting-on-the-backend) against the real server before
release.

## Quick start

1. Print the lines for `Secret.cs`:

   ```bash
   python FakeServer/fake_server.py --print-secret
   ```

2. Replace the matching lines in `Assets/Scripts/Utils/Secret.cs` with them. That file is
   git-ignored, so these values are never committed. Keep any real values somewhere safe first.
3. Start the server, and leave it running while you test:

   ```bash
   python FakeServer/fake_server.py
   ```

4. Press Play. Each request appears in the server's console.

To go back to a real backend, restore your real values in `Secret.cs`.

To test a first launch, use **Tools > Delete All PlayerPrefs** in the Editor. Fake server users
are separate: restarting the server forgets them.

## Testing scenarios

Change behaviour while the app runs by opening a URL in a browser. The response shows the
current settings, and <http://127.0.0.1:8765/__fake/> shows them without changing anything.

| To test                       | Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/__fake/set?...` |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| A request failing             | `fail=assess:503`                           |
| Several failures              | `fail=assess:503,profile:500`               |
| Slow responses and spinners   | `delay=5`                                   |
| Off-topic or partial answers  | `relevance=off_topic` or `relevance=partial` |
| No relevance check ran        | `relevance=none`                            |
| Advance button on the profile | `profile=top`                               |
| No position shown             | `profile=bottom`                            |
| Too few assessments           | `profile=insufficient`                      |
| Cohort too small              | `profile=cohort`                            |
| Rank unavailable              | `profile=unavailable`                       |
| Pronunciation warnings        | `warning=0,1`                               |
| Back to normal                | `reset=1`                                   |

Route names for `fail` are `assess`, `onboarding`, `feedback`, `profile`, `level`, `events`,
`delete`, `mdd` and `number`.

The app chooses its error message from the status code, so these are worth trying with
`fail`: `403`, `404`, `413`, `422`, `503`, and `400` or `500` for the server's own wording.
To test **no connection**, stop the server.

Most of these are also start-up options, such as `--profile top` or `--fail assess:503`. Run
`python FakeServer/fake_server.py --help` for the full list.

## Endpoints

| Method and path                   | `Secret.cs` constant    | Response                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/v1/speech/assess`      | `ASA_URL`               | Scores and labels. Each task gives a different band. |
| `POST /api/v1/onboarding`         | `ASA_CONSENT_URL`       | Creates the user, or 409 if the guid exists  |
| `POST /api/v1/feedback`           | `USER_ASA_FEEDBACK_URL` | Stored, or 422 if `assessment_id` is wrongly sent or missing |
| `POST /api/v1/analytics/comparison` | `ASA_PROFILE_URL`     | Profile stats, depending on `profile`        |
| `PATCH /api/v1/users/level`       | `ASA_SET_LEVEL_URL`     | Stores the level, which the profile then uses |
| `POST /api/v1/analytics/events`   | `ASA_EVENTS_URL`        | Counts the batch, or 400 if malformed        |
| `DELETE /api/v1/users`            | `DATA_DEL_REQUEST_URL`  | 204, or 403 if `X-Delete-Key` is wrong       |
| `POST /asr_unity`                 | `AUDIO_URL`             | One score per character, with one mistake    |
| `POST /asr_number`                | `NUMBER_AUDIO_URL`      | The same, for the number                     |

It doesn't score or save audio. Results depend only on the task or text sent, so they are
repeatable. `GPT_TTS` calls OpenAI directly and is not covered.

## Remembering users

Users are held in memory, so restarting the server forgets them. An unknown guid is accepted
by default, so a restart doesn't force the Editor through onboarding again. Use
`--strict-users` to get the real server's 404 for a user who has not onboarded.

## Testing on a phone

1. Start the server so your network can reach it:

   ```bash
   python FakeServer/fake_server.py --host 0.0.0.0
   ```

2. Print the `Secret.cs` lines using your computer's address, then rebuild the app:

   ```bash
   python FakeServer/fake_server.py --print-secret --public-host 192.168.1.20
   ```

3. Allow the port through your firewall if needed. The server has no authentication, so stop
   it when you finish.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                       | Likely cause and fix                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Insecure connection not allowed` in the Console | The project blocks plain HTTP. In **Player Settings > Other Settings**, set **Allow downloads over HTTP** to **Allowed in development builds**. This changes `ProjectSettings.asset`, so decide whether to commit it. |
| A request throws, or a spinner never stops    | The URL in `Secret.cs` is blank. `UnityWebRequest` throws on an empty URL rather than reporting a failed request. |
| Every request shows a connection error        | The server isn't running, or the port differs from `Secret.cs`. |
| `Address already in use` when starting        | Another copy is running. Stop it or use `--port`, then print the `Secret.cs` lines again. |

## Tests

```bash
cd FakeServer
python -B test_fake_server.py
```

The tests run the server over real HTTP, using bodies laid out like Unity's `WWWForm`. They
don't involve Unity, so the app itself still has to be checked in Play mode.
